Display wireless probe requests like airodump-ng in python and scapy

This program displays wireless probe requests from associated and unassociated wireless clients in range.
The output is similar to that of airodump-ng from the aircrack-ng suit.

Requirements
============

You will need a wireless card that is capable of going into monitor mode, and is compatible with aircrack.
I have only tested it on one machine! But it should work on others

Also required are of course python and the scapy libraries, and also netaddr for mac address lookups.
